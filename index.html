                <h1>Akan Names Generator</h1>
                <p>According to the Ghanian culture, people are given their first names depending<br> 
                    on the day of the week they were born. Each gender has names that correspond<br>
                    to the seven days of the week. This website is a way of calculating a person's <br>
                    Akan name depending on the day, the month, and the year they were born</p>
                <h2>How it works</h2>
                <p>The user is supposed to enter their birthday details as prompted. Don't worry, <br>
                    the day of the week in which you were born will be calculated for you too! Your<br>
                     Akan name will be displayed as a pop up on the top of the page</p>
